# Focus Extension

Focus (https://heyfocus.com) is a Mac application that blocks distractions like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc...

It works out of the box with Safari and Chrome, but needs an extension for other browsers like Firefox, Opera, Vivaldi and Brave.

This single extension should work for all of those other browsers.
